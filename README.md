* **Natural Language Queries:** Ask complex questions about financial statements in natural language.
* **Key Financial Ratios:** Calculate and display important financial ratios.
* **Trend Analysis:** Identify trends in financial performance over time.
* **[Future Features (Phase 2)]:**  Investment recommendations, ChatGPT integration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.x
* [List any required Python libraries, e.g., pandas, numpy, transformers, etc.]  Use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to generate this.
* [Specify any other dependencies, e.g., database, cloud platform, etc.]
* [If using a specific GPT model, mention it here and how to obtain it.]
* [If you have specific hardware requirements, e.g., GPU for training, mention it here.]

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone {link where it says clone repository}
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd S-PGPT
3. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
4. Install the required dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

You can't directly create a file within this chat interface.  However, I can give you the text formatted so you can easily copy and paste it into a file named README.md in your project directory.  Just copy the text below, open a text editor, paste the text, save the file as README.md, and you're good to go!
